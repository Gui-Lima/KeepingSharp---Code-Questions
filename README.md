# Keep Sharp!
Keep Sharp is a iniciative by myself to practice coding everyday in different languages.
Here you will find some questions explained and the code to solve them. In some questions there is more information about trivia, in other's don't. 

## Languages ATM
C++, Java, Python and Haskell are the languages i'm doing exercises right now.

## Future Plans
When this is more filled and with harder exercises I plan to expand the concept of "Keep Sharp!" to another stuff, so i don't practice only coding exercises but real projects.
