# Nexus of the Codewars Universe

Not to brag, but I recently became the nexus of the Codewars universe! My honor and my rank were the same number. I cried a little.

Create the nexus method to take a hash of users, and find the nexus. For each hash element, the key is the rank and the value is the honor. Return the rank of the nexus user.

If nobody has an exact rank/honor match, return the rank of the user who comes closest. If there are more than users who comes closest, return the one with the lowest rank (numeric value). The hash will not necessarily contain consecutive rank numbers, so return the best match from the ranks provided.
